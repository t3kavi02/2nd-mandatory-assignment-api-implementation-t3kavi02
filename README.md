# API Implementation Exercise - Game High Scores

This is a API implementation exercise for the Game High Scores API. The API is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The API is implemented according to the specification provided in the [Game High Scores API Specification](https://lassehav-oamk.stoplight.io/docs/gamehighscoreexercisespecification/kprm5u5uf4b5q-game-high-scores-api).

## Instructions

0. Start the exercise work early. This exercise is more complex than the previous exercises and will require more time to complete even with AI support.
1. Read the API specification
2. Implement the API according to the specification by completing the `server.js` file. Do not modify the `index.js` file.
3. To complete this exercise you must implement Json Web Token creation and validation and request validation. The correct libraries are already included in the `package.json` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
4. The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

## Running tests locally

The tests are implemented using Mocha and Chai. To run the tests, run the following command:

```
npm test
```

If your tests pass locally, then you can push your changes to the github classroom repository and the CI/CD pipeline will run the tests again.

## Submission

Commit your changes and push them to the github classroom repository. The CI/CD pipeline will run the tests and check your code for quality. If the tests pass then the exercise will be considered complete.
